#JOBJ

A collection of utilities to work with objects. Lighter than most, and does what I want
Particularly useful to work with immutables, as all functions return new objects.

I was mainly tired of always re-writting the same little functions in every project.

# Methods

{{>main}}

Additionally, it provides the following immutable replacements for mutative array functions:
`push`,`pop`,`splice`,`sort`,`reverse`,`shift`, and `unshift`.
All functions work like their native counterparts, but take an `array` argument first
(they also return an array instead of, say, the `length` property for `push`).

# Install

```sh
npm install jobj
```
